		\end{equation}
		Where $N$ is the number of times it should be executed, $T_{pipe}$ is the pipelined execution time, and $m$ is the depth of the pipeline.

			\end{equation}
			Where $l$ is the lightspeed of a loop, or how much the loop is bandwidth limited, $B_m$ is the machine balance of the machine, and $B_c$ is the code balance of the program.
		
		\subsection{Performance from Lightspeed}
			For STREAM specific performances, see (3.5) page 68.

	\section{Communication Bandwidth and Trasfer Time (p. 105)}
		To calculate the increase in effective bandwidth see (4.3) page 108.
